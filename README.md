### âœ… Interview Question Answers

**Q1. What are the key responsibilities of a Data Analyst?**
A Data Analyst is responsible for collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data to provide actionable insights. They build dashboards, create reports, and present findings to support business decisions.
ðŸ‘‰ For example, in my projects, I optimized database queries by 40%, ensuring faster data retrieval, which directly improved reporting and insights.

---

**Q2. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?**

* `INNER JOIN`: Returns rows where there is a match in both tables.
* `LEFT JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, with NULLs where no match exists in the right table.
  ðŸ‘‰ Example: In employeeâ€“department data, INNER JOIN shows employees with valid departments, while LEFT JOIN includes even those not assigned to a department.

---

**Q3. How would you handle missing data in a dataset?**
It depends on context:

* Drop missing values if dataset is large and impact is minimal.
* Use mean/median/mode imputation.
* Forward/backward fill for time-series.
* Predictive imputation for critical fields.
  ðŸ‘‰ In a project, I replaced missing income data with median values to ensure fair distribution without biasing results.

---

**Q4. Explain the difference between primary key and foreign key.**

* **Primary key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
* **Foreign key**: Links two tables, ensuring referential integrity.
  ðŸ‘‰ Example: `employee_id` as primary key in Employees, and as foreign key in Salaries table.

---

**Q5. What is data normalization in SQL?**
Normalization is structuring data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity by splitting into smaller related tables.
ðŸ‘‰ Example: Separating user profile info and login details into different tables reduces duplication and ensures consistency.

---

**Q6. What are common data visualization tools youâ€™ve used?**
Iâ€™ve used **Power BI, Tableau, and Excel** for dashboarding, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** in Python for advanced analytics.
ðŸ‘‰ In my projects, I built dashboards that improved data-driven decision-making, like analyzing website performance.

---

**Q7. How do you ensure data accuracy in your analysis?**

* Cleaning and validating data.
* Removing duplicates.
* Cross-checking with source systems.
* Sanity checks with summary statistics.
  ðŸ‘‰ At Techplement, I improved backend queries by 30%, ensuring clean and consistent reporting data.

---

**Q8. What is the difference between variance and standard deviation?**

* **Variance**: Average squared deviation from mean.
* **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance (in same unit as data).
  ðŸ‘‰ Example: If sales variance is high, it means sales fluctuate widely; standard deviation tells exactly by how much.

---

**Q9. Write an SQL query to find the second highest salary from an Employee table.**

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

Alternative:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employees 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

---

**Q10. How would you approach analyzing sales data for a company?**

* Collect & clean data.
* Identify KPIs like revenue, churn, profit margins.
* Segment by customer/product/region.
* Visualize patterns & trends.
* Recommend actions.
  ðŸ‘‰ Example: In my Quote of the Day project, I tracked API requests per second, optimized queries by 40%, and analyzed usage patterns to improve performance.

---

**Q11. Suppose sales dropped last quarter. How would you investigate?**

1. Compare with historical sales.
2. Segment by region, customer, product.
3. Check internal changes (pricing, supply).
4. Check external factors (seasonality, competition).
   ðŸ‘‰ Iâ€™d summarize findings in a dashboard highlighting the root causes.

---

**Q12. You notice outliers in your data. How do you handle them?**

* Check if itâ€™s a data error â†’ clean/remove.
* If valid, analyze business context â†’ keep, transform, or separate.
  ðŸ‘‰ Example: In website analytics, sudden traffic spikes may be valid marketing campaigns, not errors.

---

**Q13. How would you present complex findings to non-technical stakeholders?**

* Use clear visuals (charts, dashboards).
* Avoid jargon.
* Tell a story with data.
  ðŸ‘‰ For my blogging platform, I built dashboards showing user activity in a simple, visual way for non-technical stakeholders.

---

**Q14. If given a dataset with 1M+ rows, how would you optimize performance?**

* SQL: Indexing, filter before joins, efficient aggregations.
* Python/Pandas: Vectorized operations, chunking, Dask for parallelization.
  ðŸ‘‰ In my project, I optimized MongoDB queries by 40%, which handled 100+ requests/second smoothly.

---

**Q15. A manager asks for a dashboard. What steps do you take?**

1. Gather requirements (KPIs, business goals).
2. Collect & clean data.
3. Choose suitable tool (Power BI, Tableau).
4. Build visualizations.
5. Validate with stakeholders.
6. Ensure interactivity & usability.

 Statistics & Data Concepts
 Mean = average, Median = middle, Mode = most frequent.
 Variance = spread from mean (squared units).

 Missing Data: drop rows, mean/median imputation, forward/backward fill, predictive modeling.
 Outliers: remove if error, keep if meaningful (e.g. seasonal sales spike).
 Normalization: 1NF (atomic values), 2NF (remove partial dependency), 3NF (remove transitive
 dependency).

 Data Visualization & Storytelling
